Hello, you're looking at Lugami's GitHub profile! </br>
<p align="left"> <img src="https://komarev.com/ghpvc/?username=Desistirei&label=Profile%20views&color=0e75b6&style=flat" alt="Desistirei"/> </p>

# Who am I?
I am **Matheus**, a.k.a **Lugami**.</br>
I'm 15 years old *(04/November)*, currently living in Brazil (s/o brazillian homies ❤️)</br>
I'm interested in **Java, Kotlin, C#, Python, and a tiny little bit in PHP.**</br>
- I have ASD (Autism Spectrum Disorder, level 1) and my MBTI (Myers-Briggs Type Indicator) is ISTP.
- So if I happen to act weird sometimes, it MIGHT be related to that. (although I can sometimes act weird just because I want to, so yeah lol)

# What do I do in GitHub?
I mostly post some open-source **Spigot plugins** that I either coded, or modified.</br>
Starting in January 2025, I no longer code anything for Minecraft, so **Budget** & **Tails** are the last plugins released under my profile.

# What am I currently doing?
I'm currently interested in Unity/C# games, specifically, reverse-engineering them.</br>
Currently, i'm attempting to decompile **Garena Free Fire**, so if you have some knowledge about it, you can contact me.</br>

# Anything else about me?
Although I won't be on a computer frequently, I can try helping with something as long as it doesn't involve me having to code (lol)</br>
*(if anyone is wondering, i'm currently single xD)*
